# Paper files
 Code for "Forward Stability and Model Path Selection" paper. Currently, applications and motivation are easily runnable, but simulations are not. The simulations file was written to run on a computing cluster. In the future, I will write a simplified version of the simulations file, so that researchers can run 1 repetition of a simulation set-up.
